# Properties_API_Challenge
<p> 
A few weeks ago, a friend of mine become a millionaire over night <br/>
He start bying many properties and he want me to implement the backend of a <b> management property platform </b>, so he can have control over the properties.
</p>
<p>
I created a basic API that can :<br/>
<ul>
  <li> List all the users </li>
  <li> Register new user </li>
  <li> Get the data from a single user </li>
  <li> Update user data </li>
  <li> Delete a user </li>
  <li> List all properties from a user </li>
  <li> Create a property </li>
  <li> Update property owner </li>
  <li> Update property data </li>
  <li> Delete a property </li>
</ul>
